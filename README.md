# IsoCalc
Calculate the net weight of gas in an IsoPro canister.

Very simple HTML page that will tell you how much gas is left in a canister, given its current gross weight (that is, its current total weight).

Things to do: 
* Allow use of ounces?
* Add 16 canister?
* Check for bogus input values and complain?
* Make it prettier.


I may or may not keep an instance of this running at http://robcranfill.net/isocalc
